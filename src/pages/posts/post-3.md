# My Third Blog Post

Published on: 2024-04-30

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages** I then learned how to make pages creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my third blog post.

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial (define and use a variable).
